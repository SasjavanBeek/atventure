      <p>

        <strong>YOU</strong> take action. Do anything your heart wants to, no
        matter how weird it sounds. You only live ones. Here’s 10 you need to do

          <h3>1. Run a half marathon</h3>
          <p>
            That is just over 13 miles. In our life we walk 4 orbits around the
            whole earth, that is about 110,000 miles. Those 13 miles are
            nothing. Running a half marathon is a cool experience and you will
            also train your perseverance to use it in the rest of your
            adventures.

          <h3>2. Jump out of an airplane (with a parachute)</h3>
          <p>
            No one can take this experience away from you. If you've ever been
            on an airplane, you know how beautiful the view is up there. But
            trust me, the sightseeing is even better when you jump out of the
            plane. Of course with guidance ;)

          <h3>3. Volunteer</h3>
          <p>
            Volunteer for a good project or contribute to a positive change in
            other people's lives. Not only that. You will develop great skills
            and you will meet a lot of new friends.

          <h3>4. Have a cup of coffee with a stranger</h3>
          <p>
            Meeting new people can be hard. Especially when you are following
            your daily routine over and over again. Starting a conversation with
            a stranger will lead to moments you will never forget. You will also
            build a lot of self-confidence and you will learn a lot from other
            people, their stories, their behaviors, or their experiences. Nobody
            is the same and that's wonderful. You might build up beautiful
            friendships or you might meet your soulmate. You will never know.
            Try it, it's fun!

          <h3>5. Write a book and publish it</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone has a story to tell. So do you. Writing can help you
            process better. Your story can help, teach, and entertain others.
            You don’t have to write <strong>your</strong> story. Just write
            <strong>a</strong> story. A story you made up or an experience you
            had. Other people will love to read it. So why are your stories not
            out there yet? There's no reason to wait.

          <h3>6. Go for a roadtrip</h3>
          <p>
            After my road trip from San Francisco to Las Vegas with Rick and
            Leonard in 2011 I still have a wish to have a nice trip. This can
            also be around Europe. Check it off your bucket list!

          <h3>7. Pack your bags and book a mystery flight</h3>
          <p>
            Go see the world! Go with the flow and don't plan anything. This
            will lead you to the most beautiful places and memories. You can go
            with friends or you can go alone. Roadtripping by yourself will make
            you do things you never believed you could. So go for it, pack your
            backs and see where it goes (you go;).

          <h3>8. Be in a film or commercial</h3>
          <p>
            Even if you're just an extra and you're only on screen for 3
            seconds. Even if you only get to say one sentence you can honestly
            say, you are in that commercial or film.

            the moments we live for.

          <h3>10. Go skydiving</h3>
          <p>
            As a child, everyone dreams of learning to fly. Here's your chance.
            Grab it and feel as light as a feather.
