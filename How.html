      <h3>Top 10 habits to be more adventurous</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Magic happens outside your comford zone</em> That's what they say at
        least. You are what you do. If you want more adventure in your life then
        it’s down to you to get on with it and make it happen. You don’t need a
        lot of money, time or to travel to exotic locations for an adventurous
        life. But, if you don’t want to spend the rest of your life in a comfort
        bubble, you may need to develop some adventure habits; practices that
        help you create or seize opportunities for adventure that exist around
        us everyday. Forget apples; an adventure a day is the well balanced way.
        Here’s 10 adventure habits worth cultivating.

          <h3>1. Break with your routines</h3>
          <p>
            Routines are great for running an efficient life but the antithesis
            of adventure. So don’t do the same thing everyday; shake it up, vary
            it and see where that takes you. You don’t need to be radical, just
            intentional. Big adventures can flow from small changes in routine.
            So find a different way to get to work, do your weekly shop
            somewhere new, choose somewhere different to go on holiday, cook an
            unfamiliar meal for dinner, join a new club, get a new hobby, go
            meet some new people, talk to someone on the bus, or just sit in a
            different seat. Adventure can take many forms but routine isn’t one
            of them. So don’t let yours squash your explorer spirit.

          <h3>2. Give your gadgets a break</h3>
          <p>
            <em>disconnect to reconnect</em>
            I love my tech and know apps, maps and social networks can be great
            for planning, capturing and sharing adventures. But the very same
            apps that facilitate and connect can also leave us disconnected,
            dependent, even lonely. 21st century tech enables us to experience
            the world in the most incredible ways without ever getting up or
            going out, but it can’t touch you the same way raw, real world
            experience can. So put your gadgets down, give them a break and
            remind yourself what the real world is like. Meet people face to
            face, feel the warmth of a handshake and the frisson of mutual gaze.
            Forget Google glass, Sat Nav and activity trackers, get out your map
            and compass and go and get lost instead. Turn off FourSquare alerts
            and ask a stranger for a recommendation. Let your eyes be your
            window on the world and your legs be your interface. Venture out
            often and gadget free, feel the real world and let it move you.

          <h3>3. Say ‘Yes’</h3>
          <p>
            If necessity is the mother of invention, I’m sure improvisation is
            the father of adventure. I love the edgy, not quite knowing what
            happens next feeling that comes from improvising whether in music,
            in the kitchen, a relationship or a crisis. In the world of stand
            up, the first rule of improvisation is “say yes”. When invited into
            a scene, to become a character or pick up a prop, this rule says
            “say yes’ to the invitation; go with the flow, accept the idea
            offered, breathe life into it and move the improv on. You can apply
            this rule to create moments of adventure everyday by saying yes to
            those moments that invite us to break with routine and do something
            different. Take a breath, stamp down the reasons why not, and adopt
            an open mind. Step forward, accept the invitation, say yes, mean it
            and see where that takes you.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Say ‘Yes and..’</h3>
          <p>
            The second rule of improv says don’t just say ‘yes’, say ‘yes and’ –
            accept the invitation and add something to it, an idea of your own,
            a suggestion, something that takes things even further. When you say
            “yes and” you become a contributor, a co-creator. Now we’re not
            naysaying, not just accepting adventure invitations but we’re making
            them and shaping them. No more watching and waiting; we are actor
            and initiator.

          <h3>5. Take the path you’ve never travelled</h3>
          <p>
            A well trodden path is usually easy to spot while the path less
            travelled or untravelled can be hard to find. If you’re looking for
            everyday adventures neither of these are particularly useful; what
            you want is the path you’ve never travelled. The road you’ve noticed
            but never been down, the footpath you walk past every day, the
            back-road you avoid because it takes a little longer, the canal
            you’ve never found time to explore. When you take the path you’ve
            never travelled you’ll see things you’ve never seen before, perhaps
            meet people you don’t know, maybe find another path and who knows
            where that might lead. And when you get tired of paths perhaps you
            could ignore them altogether and follow your nose instead.

          <h3>6. Do talk to strangers</h3>
          <p>
            I know this probably goes against advice your parents gave you and
            contradicts stranger danger stories on the internet, radio and TV,
            but the secret truth is most strangers aren’t dangerous. In terms of
            absolute risk, talking to strangers is a pretty safe activity. It
            may be unusual, uncomfortable, even embarrassing but it’s very
            unlikely to harm more than your ego, especially if you use your
            intuition. On the plus side talking to strangers can open up new
            worlds, strange worlds where all kinds of adventures lie in wait.
            Conversations with strangers can introduce you to new thoughts and
            ideas, sports, hobbies, people and places. They can change your view
            of a place or an issue, lead you to do or try something different,
            even invite you to be someone different. So, do talk to strangers,
            the stranger the better.

          <h3>7. Rest your strengths, learn something new</h3>
          <p>
            Playing to your strengths, doing what you do well is great for the
            ego and of course there’s many an adventure to be had polishing hard
            won skills, taking them to the next level or into new and unfamiliar
            environments. But there’s also fun to be had looking the other way,
            doing what you know you’re not good at, exploring undeveloped
            skills, trying something completely new. Learning is always an
            adventure into the personal unknown, an everyday opportunity to try
            and not know if you will succeed. And, if at first you don’t
            succeed, well think of it as a chance to try and try again. And then
            when you do succeed, go try something else. And don’t let age be an
            excuse, you’re never too old to give something new a go.

          <h3>8. Gamble responsibly</h3>
          <p>
            I know this sounds like more bad advice, against the counsel of
            parents and teachers, but we all know life gets more interesting
            when there’s something at stake. But we’re not talking your money or
            your life; it doesn’t have to be high stakes. Risk and uncertainty
            are adventure fuel. They add frisson, drama, excitement, emotion,
            consequences. So if you want a bit more adventure, do the math and
            build a little in. Give luck, opportunity, coincidence and
            serendipity a chance. Take a chance on missing the last bus, risk
            going somewhere where no-one will understand a word you say, try
            something you might fail at. And see what happens. Stack the odds in
            your favour if you like but if you want things to get interesting
            make sure the outcome isn’t a dead cert.

          <h3>9. Pop your comfort bubble</h3>
          <p>
            I love comfort bubbles. They are safe, familiar, warm, fuzzy and
            undemanding. What’s not to like? Except the fact they’re not
            terribly interesting or developmental. From inside a bubble, life
            beyond may look unfamiliar, but that’s because you’re looking
            through the distorting film of the bubble itself. Just beyond this
            iridescent layer, all kinds of new experiences are waiting, within
            easy reach. So stop looking at your beautiful bubble and pop it. One
            finger and one deliberate moment is all it takes. Release that
            surface tension, step through the distorting thin film of your
            preconceptions and find out what the world beyond is really like.

          <h3>10. Do something new everyday</h3>
          <p>
            Never mind an apple a day, let’s aim for an adventure a day. That’ll
            keep the routine away. An adventure mind-set is a matter of habit,
            not money, time or expertise. Opportunities for adventure abound, we
            just need to train ourselves to notice them, seek them out, create
            them, choose them. These are practices. Practices, when practiced,
            form habits. And habits become our modus operandi. If you want a
            life of adventure then by all means dream big, then start small, get
            help if you need it, but above all else do something everyday that
            invites adventure into your life.
